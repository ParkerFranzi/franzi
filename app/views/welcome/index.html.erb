<h1><center>Franzi Family Website</center><h1>
<p>I have often thought it would be a neat idea to have a web site where we (i.e., Franzi and Bemis families) can post comments and pictures to share among the family.  I know you can do this on social media sites (i.e., FaceBook), but I really have no interest in sharing information that is used for marketing or making the site available to “the world”.  Recently Parker finished up an on-line computer course regarding web-based programming.  His final assigned before completion was to create a brand new website.  Thus, our two interests have unified!!!  This is my idea, but Parker’s creation.</p>

<p>How does it work?  You need to sign up in order to become a “member”.  When you fill out the sign-up information it comes to me for approval….thus being able to control access to just family and close family friends.  Once you are signed up, you can then sign in.  It is pretty self-explanitory after that but basically you can post and/or comment on existing posts.  Also, you can create your own gallery of pictures and/or comment on existing galleries set up by others.  Anything you create (i.e., post or gallery) can be deleted by you….or me.  Only ground rule, at least for now, is no religious or political postings!!</p>

<p>Let me know if you can think of any other alterations we might want to make to the site and I will consult with my programmer.</p>
